Data Analytics Course Module 11

# Task
This web-scraping and data analysis task requires extracting information from two sources (a Mars news site and a Mars temperature data site) and creating two delivarables. The first deliverable will scrape titles and preview text from the news site while the second will scrape and analyze weather data from a table on the data site.

# Methodology
I will first identify HTML elements on a web page, particularly id and class attributes, in order to find titles and text previews for the first deliverable and data obejcts (ids, time records, temperature values, etc) for the second deliverable. I'll use automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup.
